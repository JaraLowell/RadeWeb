# Radar and Connection Issues - Fixes Applied

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Connection Cleanup Too Aggressive
**Problem**: The auto cleanup in `JoinAccountGroup` was kicking out active users watching chat by automatically removing all existing connections when a new one joined.

**Fix Applied**:
- Modified `JoinAccountGroup` in `RadegastHub.cs` to allow up to 3 simultaneous connections per account
- Only cleans up connections when there are >= 3 existing connections (indicating likely stale connections)
- Preserves legitimate multi-tab usage scenarios
- Added detailed logging for connection management

### 2. Enhanced Connection Validation
**Problem**: No way to distinguish between truly stale connections and active browser tabs.

**Fix Applied**:
- Enhanced `ValidateAndFixConnectionState` method with connection ping testing
- Added `Heartbeat()` method for clients to indicate they are still active
- Improved connection validation by attempting to send test messages to verify connection health
- Better cleanup of genuinely stale connections

### 3. Radar Data Flow Tracing
**Problem**: Health endpoint shows all working but radar data isn't flowing to clients.

**Fix Applied**:
- Enhanced `DebugRadarSync` method with comprehensive diagnostics:
  - Checks SL client network connection status
  - Compares raw SL client avatar data with processed radar data
  - Tests both direct and group SignalR broadcasts
  - Validates radar statistics vs actual SL sim data
  - Forces display name refresh and avatar updates
- Added detailed logging to `Objects_AvatarUpdate` in `WebRadegastInstance.cs`:
  - Logs when avatar updates are received from SL client
  - Tracks event subscriber counts
  - Logs before invoking `AvatarAdded` event
  - Validates connection state before processing

### 4. Health Check False Positives
**Problem**: Health check was showing "healthy" when radar wasn't actually working.

**Fix Applied**:
- Enhanced `CheckAccountHealthAsync` in `HealthCheckService.cs` with better validation:
  - Compares SL client avatar counts vs radar avatar counts
  - Detects when SL client has avatar data but radar shows none
  - Identifies potential event subscription losses
  - Checks for extended runtime degradation issues
  - Validates coarse location data vs detailed radar data
- Improved recovery actions:
  - Better detection of event subscription issues
  - Enhanced avatar refresh and broadcasting
  - Records recovery attempts to prevent false health failures

## Key Changes Made

### RadegastHub.cs
- Modified `JoinAccountGroup()` to be less aggressive with connection cleanup
- Enhanced `ValidateAndFixConnectionState()` with ping-based validation  
- Improved `DebugRadarSync()` with comprehensive diagnostics
- Added `Heartbeat()` method for connection health tracking

### WebRadegastInstance.cs
- Added connection state validation to `Objects_AvatarUpdate()`
- Enhanced logging for avatar event processing
- Added debug logging for event subscriber counts

### HealthCheckService.cs
- Enhanced radar health validation logic
- Better detection of data flow issues
- Improved recovery actions for radar problems
- Added comprehensive logging for diagnostic purposes

## Testing Recommendations

To verify these fixes work correctly on https://mivabe.org:15277:

1. **Connection Management**: Open multiple browser tabs and verify they don't kick each other out
2. **Radar Data Flow**: Use the enhanced `DebugRadarSync` to trace data flow issues
3. **Health Validation**: Check that health endpoint now properly detects radar issues
4. **Event Subscriptions**: Monitor logs for avatar event processing and SignalR broadcasting

## Diagnostic Tools Added

1. **Enhanced DebugRadarSync**: Comprehensive radar diagnostics available through SignalR
2. **Connection Validation**: Ping-based connection health testing  
3. **Detailed Logging**: Enhanced logging throughout the radar data pipeline
4. **Health Check Improvements**: Better detection of actual radar functionality issues

## Next Steps

1. Deploy these changes to the server
2. Monitor server logs for the new diagnostic information
3. Use the enhanced debugging tools to identify any remaining issues
4. Test with multiple concurrent users to validate connection management

The fixes should resolve both the aggressive connection cleanup and provide much better visibility into radar data flow issues to help diagnose the root cause of missing avatar information.
